# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 25th June, 2025

The following text details the privacy policy of the "Gemini Bookmarks" browser
extension (referred to as "the extension").

The purpose of this policy is to explain to the user what information is handled
by the extension, why that information is handled, where that information is
stored, and how the application uses that information.

This browser extension is developed and provided by, Vandern Rodrigues, and is
intended for use as is.

## 1. What information is handled and why

At the heart of this extension is the ability to save and organize specific
responses from your Google Gemini conversations.

When you choose to save a bookmark, you provide the following information during
the creation phase:

- **Bookmark content:** The text content from the Google Gemini response that
  you choose to save.
- **Tags:** The custom tags you assign to a bookmark for organization.

The extension also handles one piece of setting information you provide:

- **Theme Setting (Text):** Your preference for the user interface's appearance
  (Light, Dark, or System)

All of the above information is used by the extension only for its core
functions: to save content for later, to display it back to you in the side
panel and modals, and to enable features like filtering and sorting.

To be perfectly clear, the extension **DOES NOT** collect, store, or transmit
any of the following information:

* Your personal information (name, email address, etc.).
* Your browsing history.
* Your passwords, cookies, or any other sensitive data.
* Any information from any website that is not `gemini.google.com`.

## 2. Where the information is stored

It is important to note that all of the information that is handled by the
extension is stored locally on your computer.

The data is **never sent to any external server or third party**. The extension
functions entirely on your machine.

This data is stored using the standard, secure `browser.storage.local` API
provided by your web browser.

I, the developer, do not have access to your bookmarks, tags, or any other
content you create.

## 3. How the information is used

As mentioned previously in section 1, the information handled by the extension
is used for displaying your content back to you and enabling the extension's
features.

The particular pieces of information used for display and organization are:

- Bookmark Content: Displayed in the side panel and the "View Content" modal.
- Tags: Displayed on each bookmark and used to populate the filter buttons.
- Internal Index: A non-visible number used to correctly sort your bookmarks in
  the order they appear in the conversation.

The piece of information used for UI customization is:

- Theme Setting: Used to apply the correct color scheme (Light or Dark) to the
  extension's interface.

## 4. Changes to this privacy policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted
on this page.

## 5. Contact information

Hope the above information is helpful to you.

If you have any additional questions or require further clarification about the
contents of this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer by sending an
